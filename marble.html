            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add to the creamed mixture, alternating with milk. Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter in half. Mix cocoa powder into one half of the batter.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of each batter alternately into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Using a knife, gently swirl the batters together to create a marbled effect.</li>
