        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, yeast, sugar, beaten eggs, and warm milk. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Add the softened butter and salt to the dough. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball or desired shape and place them in a greased baking pan or brioche molds.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough again with a kitchen towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Brush the risen dough with beaten egg wash for a shiny finish (optional).</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
