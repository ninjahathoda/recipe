            <h2>Crullers</h2>
            <p>Crullers are a classic pastry known for their twisted shape and light, airy texture. They're typically deep-fried and can be glazed or dusted with sugar.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
               <li>1 cup water</li>
              <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
              <li> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
               <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>  1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>  4 large eggs</li>
             <li>   Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
             <li> 1 cup powdered sugar</li>
             <li>2-3 tablespoons milk or water</li>
             <li> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li> In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
              <li> Once the mixture is boiling, remove the saucepan from heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball of dough and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li>
              <li> Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let it cool for about 5 minutes.</li>
              <li> Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, until the dough is smooth and glossy.</li>
               <li> Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 375°F (190°C).</li>
              <li>  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip with the dough.</li>
              <li> Pipe the dough into 3-4 inch strips directly into the hot oil, using kitchen scissors to cut the dough from the pastry bag. You can also pipe the dough into circles or twists, if desired.</li>
              <li> Fry the crullers for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
             <li> Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked crullers to a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
