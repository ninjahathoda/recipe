            <h2>American Pancake</h2>
            <p>American pancakes are a beloved breakfast staple known for their fluffy texture and sweet flavor.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
                <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
                <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
    
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if the batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges start to look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and keep warm while you cook the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with butter and maple syrup.</li>

            <h2>French Crepes</h2>
            <p>French crepes are thin, delicate pancakes that are versatile and can be enjoyed with both sweet and savory fillings. Here's a basic recipe for making classic French crepes:</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar (for sweet crepes, optional)</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, milk, melted butter, sugar (if using), and salt until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. You can also use a blender for this step.</li>
            <li>Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the flour to fully hydrate and helps prevent the crepes from tearing while cooking</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan, swirling it around to spread it thinly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to lightly brown and lift away from the pan.</li>
            <li>Use a spatula to carefully flip the crepe and cook for an additional 1 minute on the other side, or until lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the crepes warm with your choice of fillings. For sweet crepes, you can use Nutella, sliced fruits, jam, whipped cream, or powdered sugar. For savory crepes, try fillings like ham and cheese, spinach and feta, or mushrooms and cream sauce.</li>

            <h2>Dutch Baby Pancakes</h2>
            <p>Dutch Baby pancakes, also known as German pancakes, are a delightful cross between a pancake and a popover. They puff up dramatically in the oven, resulting in a golden, crispy exterior and a tender, custardy interior. Here's a simple recipe to make Dutch Baby pancakes</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

                <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or oven-safe skillet in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, flour, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth and well combined. The batter will be thin.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and add the butter to it. Swirl the skillet to coat the bottom and sides evenly with the melted butter.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the hot skillet and immediately return it to the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake the Dutch Baby pancake for 15-20 minutes, or until puffed up and golden brown around the edges. The center may remain slightly custardy.</li>
                <li>Once baked, remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the Dutch Baby pancake to a serving plate.</li>
                <li>Dust the pancake with powdered sugar, if desired, and serve immediately. You can also serve it with lemon wedges for a citrusy touch.</li>
                <li>Slice the Dutch Baby pancake into wedges and enjoy it warm.</li>
