        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Add flour and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball or desired shape and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water and baking soda to a boil.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the pretzel dough balls to the boiling water mixture, one or two at a time, for about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them back on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Brush each dough ball with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sea salt.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until pretzel bread is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
