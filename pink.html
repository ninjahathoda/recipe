    Reduce speed and add egg whites one at a time, fully incorporating after each addition. Add vanilla.<br>
    Alternate adding flour mixture and champagne, beginning and ending with flour (3 additions of flour and 2 of champagne). Fully incorporating after each addition.
    <br>Add a small amount of Fuschia color gel using a toothpick. Mix to incorporate but try not to overmix.
    <br>Spread batter evenly into prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.
    <br>Bake for approx. 35 mins or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean.
