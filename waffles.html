            <h2>Liege Waffles</h2>
            <p>Liege waffles are a delightful treat with their caramelized exterior and soft, sweet interior. Here's a recipe to make them at home:</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (80ml) warm milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (200g) pearl sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 226g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, vanilla extract, and yeast mixture.</li>
                <li>Stir the ingredients together until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky.</li>
                <li>Add the softened butter to the dough, mixing until it's fully incorporated and the dough becomes smooth and elastic. This may take some effort, but keep mixing until the butter is well combined.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 to 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, gently fold in the pearl sugar until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                <li>Preheat your waffle iron according to its manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
                <li>Place a ball of dough onto the preheated waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually for about 3-5 minutes, or until the waffle is golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove the waffles from the iron and let them cool slightly before serving. Optionally, sprinkle some additional pearl sugar on top for extra sweetness.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls until all the waffles are cooked.</li>
                <li>Serve the Liege waffles warm and enjoy their delicious caramelized goodness!</li>

            <h2>Hong Kong Style Waffles</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong Style Waffles, also known as Egg Waffles or Bubble Waffles, are a popular street food snack in Hong Kong. They're characterized by their unique spherical egg-shaped cells and have a crispy exterior with a soft, chewy interior. Here's a recipe to make them at home:</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
               <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon custard powder (optional, for added flavor and color)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>               
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your Hong Kong egg waffle maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, custard powder (if using), baking powder, cornstarch, sugar, and salt.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for about 10-15 minutes to allow the ingredients to hydrate and the bubbles to settle.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease the egg molds of the waffle maker with oil or non-stick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the molds, filling them about 3/4 full. Be careful not to overfill, as the batter will expand as it cooks.</li>
                <li>Close the waffle maker and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually for about 3-5 minutes, or until the waffles are golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the waffles from the molds using a fork or chopsticks, and let them cool slightly on a wire rack to maintain their crispiness.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter until all the waffles are cooked.</li>
                <li>Serve the Hong Kong Style Waffles warm and enjoy them plain or with your favorite toppings, such as ice cream, fresh fruit, chocolate sauce, or whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day. Reheat in a toaster oven or oven to restore crispiness before serving.</li>
