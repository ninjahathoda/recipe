        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine sliced strawberries, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Let the mixture sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the strawberries release their juices.</li>
            <li>Transfer the strawberry mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove seeds, if desired.</li>
            <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together heavy cream, whole milk, vanilla extract, and the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Stir in the strawberry puree until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.</li>
            <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.</li>
            <li>Scoop and enjoy your delicious fresh strawberry ice cream!</li>
