        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add the mango puree and yogurt (or sour cream) to the wet ingredients, and mix until well combined. Optionally, add lemon zest for an extra citrusy flavor.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost with your favorite frosting or mango cream cheese frosting.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy your delightful Mango Delight Cake!</li>
