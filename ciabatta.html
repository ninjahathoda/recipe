            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and warm water to the flour mixture. Mix until a rough dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Divide it into two equal portions and shape each portion into a rectangle.</li>
            <li>Place the shaped dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with a kitchen towel, and let it rise again for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
