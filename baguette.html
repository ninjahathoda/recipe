            <li>500g bread flour</li>
            <li>10g salt</li>
            <li>7g active dry yeast</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour and salt.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the active dry yeast with warm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and mix until a rough dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Shape each portion into a baguette shape.</li>
            <li>Place the shaped baguettes on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with a kitchen towel, and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Slash the tops of the baguettes with a sharp knife and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>
