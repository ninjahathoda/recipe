        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon barley malt syrup (optional)</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or other toppings (optional)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine bread flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add warm water and barley malt syrup (if using) to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal portions and shape each portion into a ball.</li>
            <li>Poke a hole in the center of each dough ball and stretch it into a bagel shape. Make the hole slightly larger than you want the finished bagel to be, as it will shrink during boiling and baking.</li>
            <li>Place the shaped bagels on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rise for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the barley malt syrup (if using).</li>
            <li>Boil the bagels, a few at a time, for about 1-2 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water and place them back on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Brush the boiled bagels with beaten egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or other desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the bagels for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
