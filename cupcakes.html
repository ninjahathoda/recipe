            <h2>Vanilla Cupcake</h2>
            <p>These Vanilla Cupcakes are light, fluffy, and perfect for a weekend breakfast.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, using an electric mixer on medium speed. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

                    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
